====== deadlock-prevention ======
Created 星期日 16 十月 2022

When a txn tries to acquire a lock that is held by 
another txn, the DBMS kills one of them to 
prevent a deadlock.
This approach does not require a waits-for graph 
or detection algorithm

Assign priorities based on timestamps:
→ Older Timestamp = Higher Priority (e.g., T1 > T2)
Wait-Die ("Old Waits for Young")
→ If requesting txn has higher priority than holding txn, then 
requesting txn waits for holding txn. 
→ Otherwise requesting txn aborts.
Wound-Wait ("Young Waits for Old")
→ If requesting txn has higher priority than holding txn, then 
holding txn aborts and releases lock.
→ Otherwise requesting txn waits.
