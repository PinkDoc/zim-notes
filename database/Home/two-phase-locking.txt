we need a way to guarantee that all execution schedules are correct (i.e. serializable) with out the entire schedule ahead of time.

=== Solution: ===
	Use locks to protect database objects.


=== Two-phase locking (2PL) ===
a concurrency control protocol
that determines whether a txn can access an object in database on the fly.

The protocol does not need to know all the queries that a txn will execute ahead of time.

=== Phase #1: Growing ===
-> Each txn request that locks that it needs from DBMS's lock manager.
-> The Lock manager grants / denies lock requests.

=== Phase #2: Shrinking ===
-> The txn is allowed to only release locks that is previously acquired. It can not acquire new locks.
