====== deadlock-detection ======
Created 星期日 16 十月 2022

The dbms creates a wait-for graph to keep track of what locks each txn is waiting to acquire"
-> Nodes are transations.
-> Edge from Ti to Tj if Ti is waiting for Tj to release a lock.

The system periodically checks for cycles in waits-for graph and then decides how to break it.

Selecting the proper victim depends on a lot of 
different variables….
→ By age (lowest timestamp)
→ By progress (least/most queries executed)
→ By the # of items already locked
→ By the # of txns that we have to rollback with it
We also should consider the # of times a txn has 
been restarted in the past to prevent starvation.
